"You are the only thing I have to take care of."
"I can't look at anything else while I'm taking care of you."
"You are more valuable than playing games and I always want to be with you."
"If I had to choose to write code or you, I would definitely choose to write code."
"Lots of attention for you, leave me alone and I will play a game after I write code."
"Who cares about you? I'm giving you the attention you need, now keep smiling on the phone. I'm smart enough to make you spend time with AI, not myself. I can't lose my valuable time for small things."
